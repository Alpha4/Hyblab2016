				<h6 id="text3">Analysing air pollution data for Leeds on an hourly and daily basis covering a
				period of 2010 to 2015, several important facts emerge afecting the health of
				all those living and working in the area. From the data we are able to see particular
				seasonal trends, these show increased levels of dangerous small particle
				matter during the winter months. Levels generally show an upward trend
				throughout autumn as the weather temperatures drop, this trend is reversed in
				the spring as temperatures begin increasing toward summer. In general the
				summer months show the lowest levels dangerous air pollution.
				</h6>
				<h6 id="text3">There have been periods over the period under study, which show unexplainable
				days of extreme contamination. However, the met ofce reported that
				particularly bad storms struck the Yorkshire area around the three most prominent
				events of very high contamination. Although no direct cause is possible
				to attribute to the events, the recurrence of similar outcomes tends to suggest
				the thee could be a relationship between the events.</h6>

				<h6 id="text12">This graph specifcally shows the cost of the medication prescribed

				 </h6>
				<h6 id="text12">The evolution of the curve informs us of a substantial upward
				trend in the cost of prescribed medication for Asthma or respiratory
				problem drugs and that there is a progressive rise of those
				costs through the years within the study. Additionally, the graphic
				shows the amount of medication prescribed to patients in
				Leeds over a period of fve years.
				</h6>
				<h6 id="text12">Our principal conclusion is that no specifc pattern can be observed
				 to explain any signifcant change in asthma medication
				prescribed during this period as it relates to air pollution.
				</h6>

			<div id="div_text12">
				<h6 id="text13">The comparative chart depicting air pollution in Leeds, along
				with the data concerning asthma medication prescribing during
				5 years, is presented as a means of demonstrating graphically
				the diference in incidence of high levels of air pollution and the
				timing of the prescribing of the medications within the study.
				</h6>
				<h6 id="text13">Correlating the statistics provided, the results show that there is
				no direct relationship between the two data sets. The amount of
				medications prescribed to patients increase in a period during
				late spring and early fall, when the level of air pollution is
				traditionally lower.
				</h6>
				<h6 id="text13">Therefore the results contradict the primary hypothesis much
				further research in this area is needed to establish the factors
				and causal relationships. Several avenues of exploration are pos-
				sible, but weather data covering the period in question must be
				a consideration to provide information on another of the
				contributing factors involved.
