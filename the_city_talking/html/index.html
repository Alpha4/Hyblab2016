				all those living and working in the area. From the data we are able to see particular 
				seasonal trends, these show increased levels of dangerous small particle
				matter during the winter months. Levels generally show an upward trend
				throughout autumn as the weather temperatures drop, this trend is reversed in
				the spring as temperatures begin increasing toward summer. In general the
				summer months show the lowest levels dangerous air pollution.
				</h6>
				<h6 id="text3">There have been periods over the period under study, which show unexplainable 
				days of extreme contamination. However, the met ofce reported that
				particularly bad storms struck the Yorkshire area around the three most prominent 
				events of very high contamination. Although no direct cause is possible
				to attribute to the events, the recurrence of similar outcomes tends to suggest
				the thee could be a relationship between the events.</h6>

				<h6 id="text12">This graph specifcally shows the cost of the medication prescribed

				<h6 id="text12">The evolution of the curve informs us of a substantial upward

				<h6 id="text13">The comparative chart depicting air pollution in Leeds, along

				</h6>
				<h6 id="text13">Correlating the statistics provided, the results show that there is
				no direct relationship between the two data sets. The amount of
				medications prescribed to patients increase in a period during
				late spring and early fall, when the level of air pollution is 
				traditionally lower.
				</h6>
				<h6 id="text13">Therefore the results contradict the primary hypothesis much
				further research in this area is needed to establish the factors

				sible, but weather data covering the period in question must be
